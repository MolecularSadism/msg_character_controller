Your brother fucked up the complete project. The whole job is to make ShapeCaster and RayCaster and ShapeHits and RayHits work for Avian. Save it and remove this retarded SpatialQuery workaround! Read TASKS.md. Review the progress. Actually make it work. The project MUST use these. NO WORKING AROUND IT TO GET TO THE GOAL. You are finished when ALL Avian collision detection succesfully uses this component-based approach. SpatialQuery is not allowed without my specific consent. Write comprehensive tests to ensure this all works. No deprecated bullshit, no dead code. Make it work.
